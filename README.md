🏛️ Philosophy:

    Study is not about motivation.
    Study is ritual.
    Show up.
    Start small.
    Repeat daily.
    The results will show themselves.
    This project reflects that mentality:
    No clutter
    No dopamine-traps
    Just clarity & focus


🔥 Roadmap (Coming Soon):

    ✅ Focus Mode (done)
    ⏳ Local session saving (JS)
    ⏳ Pomodoro Timer UI
    ⏳ “Error Log” memory system
    ⏳ Mobile gestures for sidebar
    ⏳ Personal profile + stats mode


🤝 Contributing:

    This is a student-first open project.
